Allegra board game 

Start the game by launching the Menu.java class. 
If you don't see any button on the main mernu, just restart the program and it should work properly


points system used :
SEE = -1
A = 0
B = 1
C = 2
D = 3
E = 4
Fx = 5
F = 6
ABS = 7
Jury = 8
TC05 = 9
TC06 = 10
R = 11

In case you are wondering why those letters, it has to do with the notation system/semesters of my school (TC05 means that you are reapeating a grade)
